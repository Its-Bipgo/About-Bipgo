**Bipgo is a social platform** that rewards its users for watching and sharing videos. In Bipgo creators can share exclusive content with their fans by offering them memberships. We redefine the concept of memberships, moving from traditional spending model (like Patreon© or OnlyFans©) to a new investment model (based on NFTs).
Bipgo has an internal economy developed using blockchain technology. Memberships are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) sold by creators and grant their owners, in addition to access to exclusive content, possibility of obtaining economic benefits.

Bipgo platform is designed to optimize engagement, by **rewarding users for watching and sharing video-based content** (Share-to-Earn model). In this model, creators are rewarded for posting content on the platform, and users for engaging with that content.

Unlike other social platforms, Bipgo is welcoming of all creator genres and their content. We consider all content can have an audience interested in consuming it, for this reason creators are free to express their ideas without restrictions and can publish almost any type of content (there are some restricted content within the platform, such as those that include: hate speech, incitement to violence, racism and copyright violations).
